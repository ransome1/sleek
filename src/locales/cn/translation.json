The closer the due date comes the higher it will be sorted. Is the due date set to today or to a date in the past, it will be marked red and will stay on top of your list. To add a due date append \"due:\" and add the due date formatted as <strong>YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. due:2021-03-07)</strong>. Alternatively use the date picker, it will do the formatting for you.",

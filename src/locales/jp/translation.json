Contexts define the situation in which this todo is relevant to you. According to David Allen's concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Things Done</a>, the \"context\" could be i.e. at home, at work, out shopping, by the phone, at your computer, with a particular person. To add a context just append a \"@\" plus the context name. For more information on todo.txt <a href=\"https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.<br><br>Neither projects nor context allow the use of spaces, so write them in one word.

If you want to change it, you need to look for the first date in your todo right after the priority tag. Todos with due dates will be bumped up your list. The closer the due date comes the higher it will be sorted. Is the due date set to today or to a date in the past, it will be marked red and will stay on top of your list. To add a due date append \"due:\" and add the due date formatted as <strong>YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. due:2021-03-07)</strong>. Alternatively use the date picker, it will do the formatting for you.",

Possible values are <strong>d</strong> (daily), <strong>b</strong> (each business day), <strong>w</strong> (weekly), <strong>m</strong> (monthly), <strong>y</strong> (anually). You can also specify a different interval, for example, <strong>rec:3m</strong> to repeat every 3rd month. <a href=\"https://github.com/ransome1/sleek/wiki/Recurring-todos\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about recurrences in sleek</a>.",

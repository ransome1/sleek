### GitHub Issue Backlog

Before starting work on sleek, we recommend reviewing the GitHub Issue backlog to align your contributions with existing issues. This helps avoid duplication of efforts and ensures that your work aligns with the project roadmap. If you find an issue that you would like to contribute to, please indicate your interest by commenting on the issue.

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment and run sleek locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/sleek.git`
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Testing

sleek uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the testing framework. To run tests, use the following command: `npm test`

To contribute to the testing efforts, consider the following:

- Write tests to cover new features or changes in functionality.
- Ensure that existing tests pass before making new contributions.
- Aim for high test coverage to maintain code quality.

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain code consistency, readability, and quality, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Write lean and efficient code. Avoid unnecessary complexity or redundant logic.
- Follow the [React coding style guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/style-guide.html) for writing React components.
- Use meaningful and descriptive variable and function names.
- Write clear and concise comments when necessary.
- Prioritize code readability over cleverness.
- Consider the user interface and user experience when adding new functionality. Strive for an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Commit Guidelines

When making commits, please follow these guidelines:

- Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages.
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
- Start the subject with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add," "Fix," "Update").
- Keep the subject line short and concise (preferably 50 characters or less).
- Provide additional details in the body if needed.
- Reference relevant issues or pull requests in the commit message if applicable.
